# Graduate Applied Ontology Society (GAOS)
GAOS is an run by graduate students who are working in applied ontology. The purpose of GAOS is to promote grad students' academic work in applied ontology; specifically, the goal is to increase the chance of getting accepted for presentation at APA. Our short-term goal is to be affiliated with American Philosophy Association and invite members. The medium-term goal is to solicit enough papers to host a special session at the upcoming Central APA meeting. Please contact @JisooSeo at jisooseo@buffalo.edu if you're interested in organizing the society and/or for more details.
